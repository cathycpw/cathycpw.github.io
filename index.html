                Hi there! I am Cathy, a master student who have just moved to the adorable city, 
                Canberra for my studies. Although Canberra is a pleasant place full of nice people,
                as a person who used to stick around with my family and friends,
                this was not an easy change for me.
                <br><br>
                
                Thankfully, my fun-loving friends have come up with 
                creative ideas that helped me through this transition!            
                I am amazed by how these little things can bring joy to us across the world.
                
                Therefore, I am developing my first website (Thank you for visiting and welcome!) 
                to share the joy with our secret ingredient - CHALLENGES!    <br><br>
    
                P.S. I feel shy for putting up a photo of myself,
                but i guess you would like to meet my cute puppy, Panda! :)

            <h2> Reflection on Web Site Development </h2>
            <p>
                Web development is way more challenging than I have imagined. 
                In the first few lectures, our professor has said that 
                "HTML/CSS is not programming..." while assuring our classmates from non-computing backgrounds that these skills shall be manageable by them.
                Being a final year computing student, 
                I imagined that developing a mini-website would only take a fraction of my time. 
                <br><br>
                This website turned out to be one of the most time-consuming project of mine - 
                and I cannot even justify for what reasons, or on which components were the time spent to.
                Nevertheless, the experience taught me the reason why web development is tricky,
                and more importantly, how could I do better in the future. 
                <br><br>
    
                <h3>1) Creativity vs. Practicality</h3>
                <p>
                    At the beginning, I have had lots of ideas that I like and felt, 
                    but then end up realised that they will not work for various reasons.
                    I was a little frustrated and doubt whether I could find a topic that I
                    truly like and can fulfill the requirements - and thankfully, 
                    the topic of CHALLENGES came to my mind and I really like it a lot. <br><br>
                    
                    This process involve a lot of considerations, and the most tricky point was me were the
                    <b>content</b> - i.e., how much content could I produce based on original ideas, or 
                    collect regularly from other sources. My domain knowledge were not enough for some of my original ideas,
                    which would have resulted in a web page that lacks originality; and
                    <b>sustainability</b> - how difficult may a web site be expanded and managed in the long-term. <br><br>
    
                    At the same time, it would also help if I had more knowledge in the topic as well as in web development. 
                    Equipping myself with more skills shall enable me to attempt developing more challenging topics of websites.                                
                </p><br><br>
    
    
                <h3>2) Users </h3>
                <p>
                    During the process, I have also learnt the importance of user understanding is in web development.
                    A previous misbelief of mine was that I well understood the "common users'" needs.
                    However, turns out different people are very diverse in terms of taste, preferences and needs. <br><br>

                    Before the class about user experience, I have actually thought that everyone (like me) 
                    would have preferred viewing web pages in dark mode. The lecture have however mentioned that 
                    contents in light mode (i.e., dark content on light background) is the most popular layout style,
                    which is also the best for the health of the eyes, which changed my strategy in layout design. <br><br>
                    
                    I have also shared the webpage to some of my friends, who help in 
                    identifying spelling mistakes and also offered great new ideas. 
                    All these existing references about users and inputs from other people are
                    very helpful in designing a product that shall better meet the larger target audience's needs.    
                </p><br><br>
                
                
                <h3>3) Planning to Plan</h3>
                <p>
                    Finally, the biggest lesson is about the importance of planning.
                    The key reason why the development has been that consuming is my lack of planning,
                    leading to countless changes of plan and some technical problems that surfaced at the later stages.
    
                    For instance, I have spent time on a JavaScript addition (colour filter for photos) for Task 2,
                    only to realise that it was rather irrelevant to my website and had to abandon the set of functions.
    
                    I have also tried to use some "quick-and-dirty" ways of implementation for convenience in several tasks,
                    but eventually had to refactored a number of style functions in HTML pages into 
                    appropriate CSS and/or javascript files.
    
                    All these waste of time could have been avoided if I have set out clearer 
                    development goals and implementation plans for my website. 
                </p><br><br>
    
    
                <p>
                    Overall, I have had a lot of fun development my first mini website.
                    Although I'm not sure whether I would have the chance to develop a full website,
                    the skills are very useful and handy for work or for-fun projects.
                    I look forward to expanding my skills and experience in this area.
